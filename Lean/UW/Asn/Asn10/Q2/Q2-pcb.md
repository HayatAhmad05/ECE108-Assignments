# Q2: Printed Circuit Boards

## Information

You work for a company that makes engine control units (ECU) for cars.  

- The ECE consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) with 20 chips on it.  
- The defect rate (probability that an ECU does not work correctly) is 3%.  
- A defect is the result of a problem in manufacturing and affects an individual ECU.  In comparison, a design bug affects all ECUs.  This question is concerned only with defects, not bugs.
- All possible defects are independent.

## Q2a: Probability of 10 Good ECUs

If you randomly sample 10 ECUs from the production line, what is the probability that all 10 of the ECUs work correctly (do not have a defect)?

### Q2a Answer

## Q2b: Component Defect Rate

An ECU works correctly iff the PCB and all of the chips work correctly.  Assuming that the PCB and all of the chips have the same defect rate, calculate the defect rate for the PCB.

### Q2b Answer
