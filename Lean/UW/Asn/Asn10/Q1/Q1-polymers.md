# Q1: Polymers

## Information

You have a friend in mechanical engineering who is developing a composite material by layering 8 different polymers named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.  Due to chemical compatibility issued, the material must satisfy some constraints about the layers.  Your friend is trying to calculate how many different arrangements of the layers can be constructed under various constraints.  Your friend knows that you are master of composite combinatorics, and so has asked you to help.

1. Each polymer is used exactly once
1. Polymer H shall be the top layer

## Q1a: Number of Possible Composite Materials

How many different arrangements of the polymers are possible if you take into account constraints 1 and 2 above and:

3. Polymers A and B must be adjacent

### Q1a Answer


## Q1b: Different Constraint

How many different arrangements of the polymers are possible if you take into account constraints 1 and 2 above and:

3. Polymer A shall not be adjacent to polymer B or polymer A shall not be adjacent to polymer C.


### Q1b Answer



## Q1c: Yet Another Different Constraint

How many different arrangements of the polymers are possible if you take into account constraints 1 and 2 above and:

3. Polymer A shall be adjacent to polymer B or polymer C. (NOTE: This is *not* the negation of the constraint from Q1b.)

### Q1c Answer
