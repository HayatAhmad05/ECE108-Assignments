# Q1b: Sensors in an Autonomous Vehicle

An autonomous vehicle has 8 different types of sensors (LIDAR, radar, cameras, etc.). For reliable operation in adverse conditions, engineers determine the vehicle needs data from:
- at least 5 different sensor types in total 
- of the 5 different types of sensors, at least 2 must come from the set {LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic}
- of the 5 different types of sensors, at least 1 must come from the set {infrared cameras, visible light cameras}. 

How many different sensor configurations satisfy these requirements?
