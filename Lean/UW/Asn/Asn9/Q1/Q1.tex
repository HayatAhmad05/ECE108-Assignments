\section*{Question 1a}

% Write your question or problem statement here.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suspension: soft, firm
    \item Steering: comfort, sport
    \item Throttle response: eco, normal, sport
    \item Transmission: efficient, dynamic
\end{itemize}

How many different driving mode combinations can be created? 

\section*{Solution}

% Write your solution here.
The new SUV can have $24$ different driving mode combinations.

This is calculated by multiplying the number of options for each aspect of the driving system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suspension: $2$ options (soft/firm)
    \item Steering: $2$ options (comfort/sport)
    \item Throttle response: $3$ options (eco/normal/sport)
    \item Transmission: $2$ options (efficient/dynamic)
\end{itemize}

Therefore: $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$ total possible combinations.

\section*{Question 1b}

An autonomous vehicle has 8 different types of sensors (LIDAR, radar, cameras, etc.). For reliable operation in adverse conditions, engineers determine the vehicle needs data from:
\begin{itemize}
    \item at least 5 different sensor types in total 
    \item of the 5 different types of sensors, at least 2 must come from the set \{LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic\}
    \item of the 5 different types of sensors, at least 1 must come from the set \{infrared cameras, visible light cameras\}
\end{itemize}

How many different sensor configurations satisfy these requirements?

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total of 8 different sensor types
    \item Must use at least 5 different sensor types
    \item At least 2 must come from \{LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic\}
    \item At least 1 must come from \{infrared cameras, visible light cameras\}
\end{itemize}

Let's identify our sets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set A = \{LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic\} (3 sensors)
    \item Set B = \{infrared cameras, visible light cameras\} (2 sensors)
    \item Set C = remaining 3 sensors
\end{itemize}

The problem asks for exactly 5 different sensor types satisfying the conditions. 
For set A, we need to select at least 2 sensors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose 2 from set A: $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways
    \item Choose 3 from set A: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ way
\end{itemize}

For set B, we need to select at least 1 sensor:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose 1 from set B: $\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways
    \item Choose 2 from set B: $\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way
\end{itemize}

Let's count the valid combinations:

Case 1: 2 from A, 1 from B, 2 from C
$\binom{3}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{3}{2} = 3 \times 2 \times 3 = 18$ configurations

Case 2: 2 from A, 2 from B, 1 from C
$\binom{3}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \times \binom{3}{1} = 3 \times 1 \times 3 = 9$ configurations

Case 3: 3 from A, 1 from B, 1 from C
$\binom{3}{3} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{3}{1} = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6$ configurations

Case 4: 3 from A, 2 from B, 0 from C
$\binom{3}{3} \times \binom{2}{2} \times \binom{3}{0} = 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1$ configuration

Total number of valid configurations = 18 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 34 configurations.
