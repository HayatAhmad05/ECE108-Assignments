# Q4: Allocating Tasks to Computers

You are developing software for an automous vehicle with two central computers.  To save money, the manufacturer has chosen one computer to be a fast computer and one to be a slow computer.  Your task is to define a sequence of tasks for each computer to perform.  

- The goal is to find an allocation of tasks between the two computers that results in the minimum total runtime to complete all tasks.
- Due to optimizations such as multithreading and pipelining, the time that a computer takes to run a task depends upon the task that was run before it.
The fast computer is 50% faster than the slow computer, so you choose to assign 50% more tasks to the fast computer.
- You have a total of 100 tasks to allocate between the two computers.

How many tests do you have to run to determine the minimum time needed to run the 100 tasks on the two computers?
